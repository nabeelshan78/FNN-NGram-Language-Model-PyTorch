Eating her curds and whey;
Along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.

To fetch a pail of water.

And Jill came tumbling after.

The mouse ran down,

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

Its fleece was white as snow;

E-I-E-I-O,
And on his farm he had a cow,

Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the waterspout.
Down came the rain and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain,
And the Itsy Bitsy Spider climbed up the spout again.

The wheels on the bus go round and round,
Round and round,
Round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
All through the town.
